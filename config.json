    "prompt": "Nationalism is on the rise, increasing the threat of war globally. Governments will build up arms to prepare.",
    "explanation": "Inside Washington we no longer have WWII veterans, we no longer have war experience that has traditional provided a peace dividend. Younger leaders do not understand the problems war brings and are now gaining a significantly higher propensity for War. As nationalism intensifies, the threat of global conflict rises, compelling governments to increase their military spending and build up their arsenals. Companies involved in defense manufacturing, cybersecurity, and advanced military technologies stand to benefit from this trend. The heightened focus on national security and preparedness presents opportunities for growth in industries that support defense initiatives and infrastructure.",
